# **GitHub Externship @ Hoppscotch**

**We ❤️ open source**

We are super excited to be a ‘Partner Organization’ of GitHub Externship 2021 and look forward to supporting all interested students to participate and contribute to our [open source projects](https://github.com/hoppscotch).

This document covers the process, expectations and guidelines for any interested student so that we can guide, mentor in the best possible manner and most importantly review your community engagement which is a critical factor along with your project idea to be selected from our organization.

**This post will be updated from time to time. So please keep an eye on it.**

Before, any of you jump in and start contributing, here are a few documents from the GitHub Externship Team which we advise every student to read through carefully and thoroughly:

- [GitHub Externship: Website](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html)
- [GitHub Externship: Program Structure](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/structure.html)

Our awesome community members frequently request for features on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GAMWxmR), [Telegram group](https://t.me/hoppscotch), [GitHub issues tab](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and we have a never ending list of awesome ideas. However, keeping in mind the 3 months time span, we have filtered through our stockpile and come up with the following ideas for [GitHub Externship](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html) program.
